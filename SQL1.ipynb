    "Q1. What is a relational database management system (RDBMS)? What are the advantages of a database management system over a file system?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "  1. RDBMS stands for Relational Database management system.\n",
    "2.  It is relational model in which data is stored in multiple tables where tables are related to each other using primary keys and foreign keys and indexes.\n",
    "3. RDBMS uses database normalization techniques to avoid redundancy in tables. It helps to fetch data faster using SQL query.\n",
    "4. It is widely used by enterprises and software developers to store large amount of complex data.\n",
    "5. Examples: SQL server, Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite\n",
    "The advantages of a database management system over a file system are :-\n",
    "It is easy to use.\t\n",
    "It is secured in nature.\t\n",
    "The data manipulation can be done.\t\n",
    "It limits redundancy and replication of the data.\t\n",
    "It offers better data integrity.\t\n",
    "It provides better physical data independence.\t\n",
    "It offers logical database independence i.e. data can be viewed in different ways by the different users.\t\n",
    "It provides better backup and recovery procedures.\t\n",
    "It provides multiple interfaces.\t\n",
    "Multiple users can access the database which is not possible in DBMS.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. In a database management system, explain the ACID properties.\n",
    "Ans- ACID is a concept that refers to the four properties of a transaction in a database system, which are: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. These properties ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data in the database, ensuring that the data does not become corrupt as a result of some failure, guaranteeing the validity of the data even when errors or failures occur. The ACID properties allow us to write applications without considering the complexity of the environment where the application is executed. This is essential for processing transactions in databases. Because of the ACID properties, we can focus on the application logic instead of failures, recovery and sync of the data.\n",
    "1. Transaction\n",
    "—  A transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single unit of work, and a transaction may consist of one or many steps. A transaction access data using read and write operations. A transaction must be an atomic unit of work, which means that all the modified data are performed or none of them will be. The transaction should be completely executed or fails completely, if one part of the transaction fails, all the transaction will fail. This provides reliability because if there is a failure in the middle of a transaction, none of the changes in that transaction will be committed.\n",
    "2. Consistency\n",
    "— This property ensures that the transaction maintains data integrity constraints, leaving the data consistent. The transaction creates a new valid state of the data and if some failure happens, return all the data with the state before the transaction being executed.\n",
    "The goal is to ensure that the database before and after the transaction be consistent. If a transaction leaves data in an invalid state, the transaction is aborted and an error is reported. The data that is saved in the database must always be valid (the data will be valid according to defined rules, including any constraints, cascades, and triggers that have been applied on the database), this way the corruption of the database that can be caused by an illegal transaction is avoided.\n",
    "3. Isolation\n",
    "— This property ensures the isolation of each transaction, ensuring that the transaction will not be changed by any other concurrent transaction. It means that each transaction in progress will not be interfered by any other transaction until it is completed.\n",
    "4. Durability\n",
    "— Once a transaction is completed and committed, its changes are persisted permanently in the database. This property ensures that the information that is saved in the database is immutable until another update or deletion transaction affects it. Once the transaction is committed, it will remain in this state even if a serious problem occurs, such as a crash or a power outage. For this purpose, the completed transactions are recorded on permanent memory devices (non-volatile) such as hard drives, so the data will be always available, even if the DB instance is restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain the concept of normalization.\n",
    "Ans- Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.\n",
    "Normalisation Forms in Sql - \t\n",
    "1NF (First Normal Form)\n",
    "2NF (Second Normal Form)\n",
    "3NF (Third Normal Form)\n",
    "BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)\n",
    "4NF (Fourth Normal Form)\n",
    "5NF (Fifth Normal Form)\n",
    "6NF (Sixth Normal Form)\n",

    "Q4. Explain the many types of query languages used in relational databases. DQL, DML, DCL, and DDL are some examples.\n",
    "Ans- \t\n",
    "1. DDL – Data Definition Language\n",
    "2. DQl – Data Query Language\n",
    "3. DML – Data Manipulation Language\n",
    "4. DCL – Data Control Language\n",
    "5. TCL - Transaction Control Language \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between the main key and a composite key? Give instances of how primary key and composite are used.\n",
    "Ans- Primary key is that column of the table whose every row data is uniquely identified. ... Composite Key is a form of the candidate key where a set of columns will uniquely identify every row in the table. Primary key is that column of the table whose every row data is uniquely identified. Every row in the table must have a primary key and no two rows can have the same primary key. Primary key value can never be null nor can be modified or updated. Composite Key is a form of the candidate key where a set of columns will uniquely identify every row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Create a table with a primary key, a column default value, and a column unique constraint in SQL.\n",
    "Ans - CREATE TABLE players ( employee_name varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY, employee_city varchar(100) DEFAULT “Mumbai”);\n",
